So I decided that Jekyll wasn't right for CJC Software Solutions site. We arent a ruby development company, our use of the language is mostly within the realms of CyberSecurity. 

As [Chris](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cjclarkson/) has a background in Golang, it seemed fitting that we use the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) site generation toolkit and the workflow for getting a site up and running has been great.
